        description:"In our Web Programming course, my team and I developed a dynamic shoe store website by using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We integrated a weather API that recommends shoes to visitors based on local weather conditions. My role involved designing the order summary and payment pages, and implementing a database-connected cart system. This experience sharpened my skills in web development and team collaboration, particularly in utilizing Git for project sharing."

        description:"For the final Game Design course project, our team crafted a 2D game in Unity that revolves around discovering spell combinations to navigate through monster areas. I created characters, props, and backgrounds, and contributed to the coding of dynamic backgrounds and animations to enrich the gameplay experience. This project was a valuable lesson in teamwork, problem-solving, and the integration of various game elements, enhancing my abilities in both game design and collaborative software development."
